# Application: Full Stack Application Back End: E-Commerce Site

Description: The goal of this application is to be able to pull for a database successfully, and return values based on what the user calls. I had to connect the database from SQL to the application, seed it, create models, and also create routes to access the information from the application. The application can also serve as an API for others who want to pull information from it in JSON format. Currently, I worked on the routes, built the models for seeding, and also created keys to link all the tables together. The routes are not all fully complete.

Usage: This application can be used by running node to start the server and then going to localhost:3001 to make the connection to go to the website.
